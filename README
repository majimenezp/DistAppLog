What is DistAppLog?
DistAppLog it's a distributed application log, for when you need to log some action or info in your application, but you want to centralize this information in a database to further analisys.

How can i use?
The app are divided in the server lib and the client lib.
You can implement the client lib in your current app, configure the client to use the server ip and port, and a name for your app(to identify in the server side) and you can start to send some loggin info.

Check the example in the solution and give at try in your app.

What component are using?
ZeroMq- To communicate the clients with the server, you need to configure an open tcp port in the server, and have this port open in the client in order to communicate with the server.
Massive - To save the data in a sqlite database, in this momment only sqlite database are supported,but you can try with sql server, and must work without problems.


TODO:
-Implement reactive extension in order to have a full asyncronous processing and support a lot of incomming messages(implemented in some form,but no tested)
-Asyncronous processing in the client side of the lib(currently uses threadpool for sending the messages)
-Improve the support for other databases (sql server, mysql, etc).
-Web frontend to administration,log view,search and a REST API for logging
-Maybe create an provider for log4net.
